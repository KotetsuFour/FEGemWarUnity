Now that the spire is in Crystal Gem hands, all we have to do is wait.

That was really fun! I never get to fight real opponents with Turquoise!
Ruby
Do you mind if I come along with you guys?
Rose Quartz
You can absolutely come with us! We'll need Gems like you.

*sigh*
Pink Diamond
Well? Now do you see that this is a lost cause?
Blue Diamond
I have to admit, I am disappointed in you, Pink.
Blue Diamond
All of these resources spent, all of this time scouting the landscape and examining the planet's conditions...
Blue Diamond
We did it because we truly believed in you, Pink. We believed that you could run your own colony.
Pink Diamond
I'm sorry I let you down. I really did want this, but...
Blue Diamond
No "but"s. You may have lost faith in yourself, but I haven't lost faith in you.
Blue Diamond
We're Diamonds. When we start something, we finish it, and we don't give up.
Yellow Diamond
Especially when a lower Gem challenges our authority.
Yellow Diamond
For the record, when this mess is cleaned up, I won't be trusting you with a new colony for at least another million years.
Blue Diamond
You can do this, Pink. You just need some assistance.
Pink Diamond
What are you saying?
Blue Diamond
I will bring my court to Earth and we will help you deal with these rebels.
Yellow Diamond
It will take some time for me to catch a free moment, but I intend to do the same.
Yellow Diamond
And when I get there, you'd better have all of the Rose Quartzes you can locate bubbled.
Pink Diamond
Blue, Yellow, I really don't think that's necessary.
Yellow Diamond
Oh, what's this? You don't want us to embarrass you by showing you how simple a matter this is?
Yellow Diamond
It's too late. You've had your chance to handle this. Now it's ours.

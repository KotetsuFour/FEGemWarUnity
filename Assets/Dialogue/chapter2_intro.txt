Rose Quartz
This is perfect! Once we capture the Lunar Sea Spire, Blue and Yellow will have to leave the Earth alone.
Bismuth
And Pink Diamond, right? This is her colony.
Rose Quartz
Right! Obviously.
Rose Quartz
But how are we going to approach? If we just come in the main entrance, we'll be seen from a mile away.
Pearl
Wait a minute...

Rose Quartz
A Ruby? What are you doing here?
Ruby
I was just guarding the private entrance-- Wait, that's classified! If you ask me, I should be the one asking you what you're doing here.
Ruby
And it seems like what your doing here is being up to no good!
Ruby
I just caught you red-handed! Ha!
Bismuth
You know you're outnumbered, right? And we're the ones who just caught you.
Ruby
...
Ruby
Dang it! How am I supposed to explain to my Turquiose that I got captured?! This is humiliating!
Rose Quartz
You know, if you were to help us get in the private entrance and capture the spire, I suppose we could let you go.
Rose Quartz
Your Turquoise wouldn't even have to know.
Ruby
Hm... I guess I have no choice. Okay, I'll do it.
Ruby
But if you see my Turquoise in there, tell her I had nothing to do with this.
